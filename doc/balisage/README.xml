    writing conference papers, along with related materials:</para><itemizedlist><listitem>
      <para><code>balisage-html.xsl</code> is a <quote>plain preview</quote> stylesheet generating a
        simple (HTML) web page suitable for printing. The CSS file <code>balisage-plain.css</code>
        is referenced by HTML generated by this stylesheet, and should be placed alongside these
        results.</para>
      <para>This stylesheet may be used <quote>standalone</quote>.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><code>balisage-proceedings-html.xsl</code> generates an HTML version of a paper in the
        form it will appear in conference proceedings, with <quote>Proceedings look and
        feel</quote>. The CSS stylesheet <code>balisage-proceedings.css</code> should be used with
        its results.</para>
      <para>This stylesheet calls in <code>balisage-html.xsl</code> as an imported module, so that
        the logic used by both stylesheets is consistent. (Only the layout is different.) It will
        not work if <code>balisage-html.xsl</code> is not also present in the same
        subdirectory.</para>
      <para>It will be a kindness to Balisage <emphasis role="ital">not</emphasis> to post on the
        Internet any XML using this stylesheet or HTML generated from it. In order to avoid brand
        confusion, please use the plain preview stylesheet instead, or a variant you create for
        yourself.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Three graphic icons are called by the results of the Proceedings look-and-feel
        stylesheet, and should be placed in the subdirectory where these results (or the XML source,
        if rendering in a browser) are placed:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><code>minus.png</code>: <inlinemediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata fileref="minus.png" format="png"/>
              </imageobject>

      </itemizedlist>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>In addition, the CSS stylesheet <code>balisage-author.css</code> is provided, to apply
        directly to a Balisage paper, for use (for example) in structured editors. It is standard
        CSS and should work in a variety of tools, with minimal modification or tuning. (It has been
        tested in oXygen 11.2).</para>
      <para>This stylesheet calls in an additional CSS stylesheet, <code>docbook-table.css</code>,
        to handle table formatting. Even without this module, it should degrade gracefully (although
        of course tables will not be supported as fully).</para>

    <title>How to use the XSLT</title>
    <section>
      <title>In a browser</title>
      <para>Web browsers now supporting XSLT 1.0 transformations include Mozilla/Firefox, MS
        Internet Explorer, Apple Safari, Opera, and others. Browsers generally support a standard
        binding mechanism between an XML document and a stylesheet, in this
        form:<programlisting xml:space="preserve">&lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="balisage-html.xsl"?></programlisting>Place
        this code (referencing the stylesheet you want) at the top of your document, and open it in
        your browser. (Note that some browsers require the stylesheet to be in the same subdirectory
        as the document, out of security concerns.)</para>
      <para>When using a browser to transform your XML directly, CSS stylesheet(s) and icons should
        be in the same subdirectory as the (XML source) document, and images called by the document
        should be positioned correctly relative to it.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>In a standalone processor</title>
      <para>The stylesheets use standard XSLT 1.0, so any conformant XSLT 1.0 processor can convert
        XML valid to the Balisage 1.2 DTD (or to RNG or XSD variants thereof) into HTML.
        Configuration will depend on your tool.</para>
      <para>After running a transformation and writing (serializing) the HTML results to a file, be
        sure that CSS stylesheets and icons needed for the display are placed in the same
        subdirectory as the HTML file, and that any images called by the file are positioned
        correctly relative to it.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>How to use the CSS</title>
    <para>To achieve formatted display in a structured XML editor such as oXygen, XMetaL or XMLMind,
      use the <code>balisage-author.css</code> stylesheet provided here, binding it with a similar
      processing instruction at the top of your XML
      document:<programlisting xml:space="preserve">&lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" href="balisage-author.xsl"?></programlisting></para>
    <para>Note that depending on your authoring environment's support of CSS, you may have variable
      results. Consult your product documentation, or compare this CSS directly with CSS known to
      work in your tool, if you find adjustments need to be made.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Examples</title>
    <para>This README document is an example of a valid Balisage paper with its stylesheet linked:
      open it in a browser and see (if you haven't already). As distributed, it calls in the plain
      preview stylesheet.</para>
    <para>In addition, a mockup of a Balisage paper, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="new"
        xlink:actuate="onRequest">TagZoo.xml</link>, calls the Proceedings stylesheet.</para>
    <para>In both documents, the <code>DOCTYPE</code> declaration has been commented out to
      facilitate processing in uncontrolled environments; to validate either, correct and uncomment
      its declaration, or include another schema binding.</para>

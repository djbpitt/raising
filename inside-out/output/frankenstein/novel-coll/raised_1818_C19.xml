Her hair of a shining <seg xml:id="C19_app16-f1818_end"/>

            <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_chapter12_div4_div13_p5">“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger.

Some conversation took place between him and his father; and the young stranger knelt at the old man’s feet, and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her, and embraced her affectionately.</p>
            <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_chapter12_div4_div13_p6">“I soon perceived, that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds, and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by, <seg xml:id="C19_app22-f1818_end"/>

               <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app26-f1818_start"/>happy, and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of <seg xml:id="C19_app26-f1818_end"/>

               <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app28-f1818_start"/>sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me, that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson, most of <seg xml:id="C19_app28-f1818_end"/>
               <seg xml:id="C19_app29-f1818_start"/>them indeed <seg xml:id="C19_app29-f1818_end"/>

When they separated, Felix kissed the hand of the stranger, and said, ‘Good night, sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by the frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.</p>
            <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_chapter12_div4_div13_p8">“The next morning Felix went out to his work; and, after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and, taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful, that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the <seg xml:id="C19_app34-f1818_end"/>

She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared enraptured, and said some words, which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.</p>
            <p xml:id="novel1_letter4_chapter12_div4_div13_p10">“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration, that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.

    * Note that the virtual elements in this input cannot all be raised.
    * There are thus multiple possible targets:
    * target.peergynt_sp.xml raises the dramaturgical hierarchy. 
    * target.peergynt_vv.xml raises the verse hierarchy. 
    * target.peergynt_io.xml raises inner virtual elements. 
    * target.peergynt_lr.xml raises left-to-right, opportunistically.

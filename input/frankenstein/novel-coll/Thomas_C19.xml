            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p337"/>“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to <seg xml:id="C19_app7-fThomas_end"/>

            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app11-fThomas_start"/>the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently; and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he <seg xml:id="C19_app11-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C19_app12-fThomas_start"/>inquired <seg xml:id="C19_app12-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app13-fThomas_start"/>the cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music, when some one tapped at the door.<p ana="end" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p337"/>
            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p338"/>“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a countryman as a guide. The lady was dressed in a dark suit, and covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a question; to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was musical, but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady; who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.<p ana="end" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p338"/>
            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p339"/>“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, <seg xml:id="C19_app13-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C19_app14-fThomas_start"/>and, <seg xml:id="C19_app14-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app15-fThomas_start"/>dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation took place between him and his father; and the young stranger knelt at the old man’s feet, and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her, and embraced her affectionately.<p ana="end" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p339"/>
            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p340"/>“I soon perceived, that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds, and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by, <seg xml:id="C19_app15-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C19_app16-fThomas_start"/>or <seg xml:id="C19_app16-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app17-fThomas_start"/>herself understood, the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not comprehend; but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy, and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of <seg xml:id="C19_app17-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C19_app18-fThomas_start"/>one <seg xml:id="C19_app18-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app19-fThomas_start"/>sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me, that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson, most of <seg xml:id="C19_app19-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C19_app20-fThomas_start"/>them indeed <seg xml:id="C19_app20-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app21-fThomas_start"/>were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.<p ana="end" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p340"/>
            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p341"/>“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they separated, Felix kissed the hand of the stranger, and said, ‘Good night, sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by the frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.<p ana="end" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p341"/>
            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p342"/>“The next morning Felix went out to his work; and, after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and, taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful, that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the woods.<p ana="end" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p342"/>
            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p343"/>“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared enraptured, and said some words, which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.<p ana="end" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p343"/>
            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p344"/>“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration, that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.<p ana="end" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p344"/>
            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p345"/>“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun; for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment <seg xml:id="C19_app21-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C19_app22-fThomas_start"/>as <seg xml:id="C19_app22-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app23-fThomas_start"/>I had formerly endured in the first village which <seg xml:id="C19_app23-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C19_app24-fThomas_start"/>I entered. Nay if by moonlight I saw a human form, with a beating heart I squatted down amid the bushes fearful of discovery. And think you that it was with no bitterness of heart that I did this? It was in intercourse with man alone that I could hope for any pleasurable sensations and I was obliged to avoid it—Oh truly, <seg xml:id="C19_app24-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app25-fThomas_start"/>I <seg xml:id="C19_app25-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C19_app26-fThomas_start"/>am grateful to thee my Creator for the gift of life, which was but pain, and to thy tender mercy which deserted me on life’s threshold—to suffer—all that man can inflict<p ana="end" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p345"/>
            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p346"/>“My <seg xml:id="C19_app26-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app27-fThomas_start"/>days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little, and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken.<p ana="end" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p346"/>
            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p347"/>“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters, as it was taught to the stranger; and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.<p ana="end" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p347"/>
            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p348"/>“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s <seg xml:id="C19_app27-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C19_app28-fThomas_start"/>Ruins <seg xml:id="C19_app28-fThomas_end"/>

            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app31-fThomas_start"/>I should not have understood the purport of this book, had not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history, and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics; of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians; of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans—of their subsequent <seg xml:id="C19_app31-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C19_app32-fThomas_start"/>degeneration—of <seg xml:id="C19_app32-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app33-fThomas_start"/>the decline of that mighty empire; of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere, and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.<p ana="end" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p348"/>
            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p349"/>“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle, and at <seg xml:id="C19_app33-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg xml:id="C19_app34-fThomas_start"/>another <seg xml:id="C19_app34-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app35-fThomas_start"/>as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I turned away with disgust and loathing.<p ana="end" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p349"/>
            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p350"/>“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty; of rank, descent, and noble blood.<p ana="end" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p350"/>
            <p ana="start" loc="novel1_letter4_chapter12_p351"/>“The words induced me to turn towards myself.

            <seg xml:id="C19_app45-fThomas_start"/>endowed <seg xml:id="C19_app45-fThomas_end"/>
            <seg type="invariant-MissingWit" xml:id="C19_app46-fThomas_start"/>with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man.

I admired virtue and good feelings, and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers; but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha, and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian, were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man, and the lively conversation of the loved Felix, were not for me.

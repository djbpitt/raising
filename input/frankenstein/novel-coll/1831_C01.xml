            point of view to the imagination for the delineating of human passions more

            season was cold and rainy, and in the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood fire,
            and occasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of ghosts, which happened to
            fall into our hands. These tales excited in us a playful desire of imitation. Two other
            friends (a tale from the pen of one of whom would be far more acceptable to the public
